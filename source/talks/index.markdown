### Ruby: Past, Present and Beyond the Web

This is a portuguese-only talk that my dear friend [Let√≠cia](http://twitter.com/_leticia) and I gave in the 2013 edition of the [Latin-American Free Software Festival](https://flisol.net/FLISOL2013/Brasil/PortoAlegre) here in Porto Alegre, about the past, the current situation of the programming language Ruby and the many uses it has without Rails and outside the Web.
