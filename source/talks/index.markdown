Here you can find some of the talks I gave in different places and situations, along to a small description of each one.

### Remote Working with Vikings: Tools and Tricks from far far away

This talk was featured in several local events, from [The Developers Conference](http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br/tdc/2014/) to [TcheLinux](http://poa.tchelinux.org/) and some events at local universities (known as _academic weeks_) like SenacRS, Unisinos and Feevale.

It basically explains a bit of our case working with Avidity's team based in Sweden and how we improved our communication skills to deal with the difficulties of remote team work, of the huge cultural difference and of the communication with people that have such a distinct cultural background to get to a very united and "close" team, despite the actual distance and the time zone.

### Ruby: Past, Present and Beyond the Web

This is a portuguese-only talk that my dear friend [Let√≠cia](http://twitter.com/_leticia) and I gave in the 2013 edition of the [Latin-American Free Software Festival](https://flisol.net/FLISOL2013/Brasil/PortoAlegre) here in Porto Alegre, about the past, the current situation of the programming language Ruby and the many uses it has without Rails and outside the Web.

### RealDay: An Introduction to Angular.js

At [RealCompare](https://www.seguroviagem.srv.br/quem-somos) we saved a few days to trainings, presentations and general hacking with our team, we named them _RealDay_, and in one of these days I gave this presentation to the crew just to introduce and promote discussion about Angular.js and other Javascripts frameworks.

### RealDay: An Introduction to Test Driven Development

In another _RealDay_ focused on testing I had the pleasure to present this small introduction to TDD, a topic that started a really great discussion about automated tests.
