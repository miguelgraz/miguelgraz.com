Here's a brief list of my side/pet projects, mostly things built to test some tools and/or have some hacking fun :)

### PokeWho: How's that Pokémon?


[{% img center /images/projects/pokewho.png 960 486 'PokeWho' 'PokeWho' %}](http://www.pokewho.com)

[PokeWho](http://www.pokewho.com/) is a small Angular.js experiment made in one friday hacking with some friends at [RealCompare](https://www.seguroviagem.srv.br/quem-somos), we were wondering about what to build to test Angular.js and one of us (can't remember now, sorry) came with the wonderful idea of, using [PokéAPI](http://pokeapi.co/), build a "who's that pokémon?" challenge.

It was really fun to work on it and have some insights about how to consume a REST API using JS with Angular, also after some mentions on facebook and [pokémon's subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon) it actually had _lots_ of access, including from people that discovered things like "when I catch 700+ pokemón the site breaks" while I cannot catch more than 30. I also learned that the word "pokémon" is already singular and plural!

For now it isn't open source but will be in the near future, also I plan to reduce it to have just the original 150 pokémon (it's really hard to memorize 718 pokémon!), I'll update here when it's done.

## More to come...
