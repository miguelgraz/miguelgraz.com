    <strong>Well hello there! I'm Miguel, also known in the internet world as Miguelgraz. I am a software developer/engineer passionate both by code and people.</strong>
  </div>

  <p>I believe it's always good to be in touch with different points of view and habilities, so I'm here to share <a href="{{ root_url }}/blog">some thoughts and techie skills</a> that can hopefully be useful for someone.</p>
  <p>Most of the time you can find me working with Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Javascript, Backbone.js and others with <a href="https://coderwall.com/team/yaydev" target="_blank">this amazing team</a>, helping someone to bike on city streets, trying to get any better on Kung-Fu or reading/playing something.</p>
  <p>I'm also trying to write more about <a href="{{ root_url }}/projects">my pet projects</a> and describing <a href="{{ root_url }}/talks">my talks</a>, because all knowledge is relevant and why wouldn't we take a change to give back to community, right?</p>
  <p>
    Well, sit back, make yourself comfortable and read my last post:
    {% assign post = site.posts.first %}
    <a href="{{post.url}}">{{post.title}}</a>
  </p>
